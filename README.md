# Birdhouse Overlay
Colored overlay reminder for users to fill seeds when building birdhouses. Overlays status of birdhouse (unbuilt, unseeded, seeded) in game. 

To use, enable the plugin in the sidebar. The sidebar will show options to set colors (can be set to no color)
for each state.

This plugin is meant to be used in conjunction with the _Timetracking_ plugin for birdhouses in order to be notified when birdhouses are ready to be collected from.
